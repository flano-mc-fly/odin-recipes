    <h2>Description</h2>
    <!-- A paragraph with a description of the meal. -->
    <p>Pancakes are a flat cake, often thin and round, prepared from a 
        starch-based batter that may contain eggs, milk, and butter and cooked 
        on a hot surface such as a griddle or frying pan, often with oil or butter.
    </p>
    <p>Another variant is to make a thick pancake, which are fluffier and thicker 
        than the traditional thin pancakes. These are often referred to as 
        "American-style" pancakes and are typically served stacked high with 
        butter and syrup.
