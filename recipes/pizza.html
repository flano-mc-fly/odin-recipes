    <h2>Description</h2>
    <!-- A paragraph with a description of the meal. -->
    <p> Pizza is a delicious dish that is loved by many people. 
        It is a flatbread that is topped with tomato sauce, cheese, 
        and various toppings such as pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives. 
        Pizza is typically baked in an oven and is a popular dish in 
        many countries around the world. It is often served as a quick 
        and easy meal and is perfect for sharing with friends and family. </p>
    <p>I discovered that it takes not very much effort to make a very good 
        pizza at home. The dough is easy to make and can be customized with 
        your favorite toppings. You can also experiment with different 
        types of cheese and sauces to create your own unique pizza recipe. 
        I hope you enjoy making and eating this delicious dish as much as I do! </p>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <!-- An ordered list for a step by step instruction on how to cook the meal -->
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>Take a large container with a lid and put all the ingredients 
            for the pre-dough in it.</li>
        <li>Seal the container with the lid and shake it. The flour and water 
            should come together, but not be fully mixed. In the end, it should have
            a flaky consistence and there should be no unbound flour.</li>
        <li>Let the pre-dough rest at room temperature for 1 hour. 
            After that, put it in the fridge and let it rest for 24 - 48 hours.</li>
        <li>Mix salt, water and yeast. Put the pre-dough in the kneading machine
            and add the salt-water-yeast-mixture little by little. 
            Knead the dough until it's smooth. Approximately 10-20 minutes. You can
            knead by hand, but this will take longer and it's not easy to incorporate
            the water in the pre-dough.</li>
        <li>Put the dough on the table and put some olive oil on your hands. Now
            stretch the dough and fold it. Repeat this step 3-4 times. 
            After that, form a ball and let it rest for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300Â°C (or as hot as possible). 
            Put a baking stone in the oven.</li>
        <li>Split the dough into 5 equal parts and shape each into a small ball.</li>
        <li>Place the 5 balls in a box with approximately 4 fingers widths between them. 
            Cover the box with a lid and let the dough balls rest for another hour.</li>
        <li>Put flour on a plate until it's filled. Sprinkle flour over the dough you
            want to use. Take the dough and put it on the plate and cover it
            on both sides with a lot of flour. Transfer the dough to the table. 
            Now stretch the dough with your hands.</li>
        <li>Put the sauce on the dough and add the cheese and the toppings you like.</li>
        <li>Put the pizza on a pizza shovel and put the pizza in the oven. 
            Bake it for 5-10 minutes. The pizza is ready when the cheese is melted 
            and the crust is golden brown.</li>
